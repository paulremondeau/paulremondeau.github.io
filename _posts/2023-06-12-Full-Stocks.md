Welcome to the FullStocks project.

I started this in order to learn the Vue.js 3 framework and the REST convention.

The application aim to allow users to visualize stocks informations.

The application is live [here](https://fullstocks.onrender.com).

You can find more information about the project on the [github](https://github.com/paulremondeau/fullStocks).

You can also find the backend documentation on this [link](https://paulremondeau.github.io/fullStocks/) !
