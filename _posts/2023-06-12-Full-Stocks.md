Welcome to the FullStocks project.

I started this project to learn the Vue.js 3 framework and the REST convention.

The application aims at enabling users to visualize stocks informations.

You can access the live application [here](https://fullstocks.onrender.com).

You can find more information about the project on [github](https://github.com/paulremondeau/fullStocks).

You can also find the backend documentation following this [link](https://paulremondeau.github.io/fullStocks/)!
